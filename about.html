        <p class="txtt">Hello everyone,

          Good to see you here, reading about me. My name is Ahan Suryavanshi, and I am happily not engaged to anyone or you can just say "I HAVE CRUSH". I don't know if it is really me in the background photo because, to my knowledge, it's hard to get my face revealed. So, the photo is just to satisfy the needs of those who want to know my face. The real face will remain a mystery that you all need to find out.
          
          My hometown is Pune, Maharashtra, India (can't mention more than this üôÇ ). My birthday is on November 29th, XXXX (year not to be mentioned üôÇ ). I am the founder of your beloved organization, PANTHERS ESPORTS, established on September, 2021.
          
          A little about my startup: I started my journey as a YouTuber and gamer, but due to some issues, I had to close that YouTube channel üò¶. Then I became a professional editor, completing a course on Adobe Premiere Pro. In 2021, I started PANTHERS ESPORTS ORGANIZATION, and now I am also doing editing alongside it. I am very thankful for your love and support towards us. I am not alone here but have a small team to help me reach this point. Below you will find some information about those teammates.
          
          Thank you to everyone in the community, staff, friends, and everyone who supported and placed their trust in me, helping me reach this stage. It wouldn't have been possible without all of you. It has been a good journey with you until this moment, and I look forward to going even further with all of you.
          
          LOVE YOU ALL ‚ù§Ô∏è

        <p>Hello, fantastic viewers and gaming aficionados,

          It's an absolute pleasure to address you as the CEO of Panther's Esports. As someone who's traversed the realms of gaming, from being a player in the esports arena to now orchestrating thrilling Valorant tournaments, I couldn't be more thrilled to be part of this exhilarating journey.
          
          Gaming isn't just a pastime for me; it's a passion that has fueled my ambition and creativity. Having once been in your shoes, competing in esports battles, I know the adrenaline rush that comes with every victory and the invaluable lessons that losses teach us. It's an honor to now stand on the other side, fostering an environment where gamers can showcase their talents and make memories that'll last a lifetime.
          
          While my days are filled with virtual clashes, my heart finds solace in the embrace of nature. The rustling of leaves, the whispering of the wind ‚Äì these are the symphonies that rejuvenate my spirit. Just as I've learned the art of perfecting a gaming strategy, I've also learned that humility, kindness, and a healthy dose of fun are what truly make us thrive as individuals and as a community.
          
          So, let's embark on this epic adventure together, where pixels and passion intertwine. Panther's Esports isn't merely a platform; it's a family, where competition meets camaraderie, and victories are celebrated with the utmost sportsmanship. In this world of fierce battles and thrilling moments, never forget to cherish the friendships forged along the way.
